## Learning Journey

Developing this Amazon clone has been a rewarding experience. It allowed me to explore ecommerce development in depth, particularly focusing on creating an intuitive user interface and integrating key features like Stripe checkout and a favorites system.

The use of Redux Toolkit for state management was a highlight, enabling efficient state updates and simplifying the overall state management process.
